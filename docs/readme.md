# Organic Framework
It is a framework for making Proven Business Application with edge of new features.     

## Preface

before creating computers ,means of `web` was the classic circular form spider's web.
- pros :  flexural , compressional ,tensional
- cons : unclear,dirty,unsafe,non-structural

after become internet these properties inspired in WEB(W3C).

primary web programming for web browser is javascript . it is similar to classic circular form spider's web . 
- pros: Speed,Simplicity,Versatility,light for Server Load
- cons : low-security,dirty-code,reliance on End User. 
 
 after 17 years from raise javascript , introduce  typescript by microsoft , typescript is more realiable , fixed many cons of JS , also it is compile(transpire) to high-qulity-js  
`TypeScript = C# + Java + JS + JS + (0.3*Pascal) `
  
we decide for better and simpler code use "View Only" approach for frontend-section,
in "view only" frontend developer focus on render functions with functional programming paradigm. According many research best framework for functional frontend was react, react has not DSL language for view , it is use ES6Feaures(New Version of JS) for preparing & rendering. It is strong milestone for many developer. also we need to application development for structural Lanaguge , we choice TypeScript language. It is more clear,developer-friendly and fun.


every view in our project is a tsx(typescript+xml) file, for example /view/dashboard route to dashboard.tsx, 
**In others words  we select with all powers react+typescript** .
